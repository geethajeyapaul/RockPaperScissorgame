# Project_RockPaperScissorsgame

Rock, paper and scissor is a hand game which is played between two peoples. It has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win or a loss.
A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or "breaks scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"), 
but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). 
If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually replayed to break the tie. 

Here, in this game that we are going to play, you will be playing against the computer. The computer randomly chooses one option in: Rock, paper or scissor.
As a player you will chose one option in:  Rock, paper or scissor. Then both the options chosed will be checked. If you and the computer make the same choice, itâ€™s a tie.
If you chose Rock and the computer chose Scissors, the user wins. Similarly, if you chose Paper and the computer chose Rock, or if you chose Scissors and the computer chose Paper, then you win. 
For you to win, one of these conditions must come true and if none of these conditions are true, this means that the computer has won.
